# MFA | Net | Quickstarts
**Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**: An additional layer of security requiring more than one form of verification.

## Tools
- Projects like [FreeOTP](https://freeotp.github.io/) and [privacyIDEA](https://www.privacyidea.org/) provide MFA solutions to add an extra layer of security.
- [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) supports Multi-factor Authentication (MFA). It allows for additional security by requiring users to present two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource. Keycloak's flexibility in configuring MFA includes options like one-time passwords (OTP), mobile authentication, and more, enhancing the security of your applications.
