 # ZTNA | Net | Quickstarts
**Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)**: is a security model that assumes no inherent trust for any entityâ€”inside or outside the network perimeter. Instead, it requires verification and authorization for every access request to resources, regardless of location. ZTNA uses strict identity verification, least-privileged access principles, and microsegmentation to ensure secure access to applications and data.
