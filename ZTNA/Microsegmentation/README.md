# Microsegmentation | Net | Quickstarts
**Microsegmentation**: Divides data centers and cloud environments into secure zones to isolate workloads from one another and secure them individually.

## Tools
- While not typically associated with a single open-source project, tools like [Kubernetes network policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) and [Open vSwitch](https://www.openvswitch.org/) can be used for implementing microsegmentation in cloud-native environments.
