# Application Dictionary | Net | Quickstarts
This concept represents a shift towards a more dynamic, application-focused approach to network security and policy management, leveraging detailed application information to streamline processes, enhance security, and facilitate clearer communication among all parties involved.

The concept of an "Application Dictionary" as outlined in your description can be summarized through the following key points and features:

- **Centralized Knowledge Base:** An "Application Dictionary" acts as a centralized repository that contains detailed information about applications within an organization and how they interconnect.
- **Enhanced Security Posture:** It aims to maintain and improve an organization's security posture by serving as a reliable Source of Truth (SoT) for application information and network configurations.
- **Facilitates Communication:** Simplifies the communication process among different stakeholders (application owners, security engineers, requestors) by allowing them to reference applications in terms of functionality rather than technical specifics like IP addresses and protocols.
- **Ownership and Responsibility:** Encourages shared ownership and responsibility among all parties involved in application management and security policy definition.
- **Rule Management:** Assists in managing firewall rule objects more efficiently and addresses challenges related to rule ownership, modifications, and the impact on associated rules.
- **Application-centric Security:** Moves towards an application-centric security model, where access and rules are defined based on applications and their services rather than traditional network-centric approaches.
- **Automation and Natural Language Processing:** Utilizes a form of near-natural language processing to allow application owners to define and request services in an intuitive manner, improving the accuracy and efficiency of rule implementation.
- **Review and Approval Process:** Incorporates a review process for service subscriptions and application changes, which may or may not involve application owners directly, depending on the nature of the service.
- **Integration with Modern Technologies:** Adapts to modern infrastructure technologies like containers, hypervisors, and cloud services by providing relevant security policies and configurations.
- **Data Model and RBAC:** Requires a sophisticated data model and role-based access control (RBAC) to manage application definitions, security policies, and user permissions effectively.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Supports the continuous improvement of security controls and policies by aligning them with the evolving landscape of applications and infrastructure.
- **Troubleshooting and Reconciliation:** Addresses challenges in troubleshooting and reconciling intended versus actual configurations, emphasizing the importance of the SoT in maintaining consistency.
